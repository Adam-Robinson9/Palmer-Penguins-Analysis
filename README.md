# Palmer Penguins: Statistical Modeling & Visualisation

An end-to-end data analysis project using the Palmer Penguins dataset in R. Focused on data cleaning, statistical testing, visualisation and predictive modelling.

Built in R with R Markdown, demonstrating applied data science skills with clear documentation.

## Features
- Data cleaning by handling missing values and summarising the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with descriptive statistics and plots.
- Statistical testing using ANOVA and t-tests.
- Predictive modeling with a decision tree classifier:
  - 70/30 train-test split.
  - Achieved 96% model accuracy.
- Clear conclusions with suggestions for future improvements.   

## Tech Stack
* R  
* R Markdown  
* Libraries: palmerpenguins, rpart, knitr 

## What I Learned

Working on this project gave me the opportunity to complete a data science workflow, taking raw data to produce statistical insights and predictive modeling:

#### Data Cleaning and Exploration
* Inspected the dataset, identified missing values and prepared a clean dataset.  
* Generated insightful statistics and visualisations including boxplots, bar charts and scatter plots.  

#### Statistical Analysis
* Applied ANOVA and t-tests to test significant differences between penguin species.  
* Interpreted results with both p-values to draw conclusions.  

#### Predictive Modeling
* Built and evaluated a decision tree model using a 70%/30% train-test split.  
* Measured accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using a confusion matrix.  
* Achieved 96% accuracy, including perfectly classifying Gentoo penguins and strong performance for Adelie (93% sensitivity) and Chinstrap (95.8% sensitivity).

#### Reproducible Reporting
* Created an R Markdown report with embedded code, results, and narrative.  
* Effectively communicated insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.  

This project strengthened my skills in data analysis, hypothesis testing, statistical modelling, and communication.
